These rolls are wonderful. I had to bake them at 325 degrees because the 400 degrees that the recipe calls for burned them at the bottom while failing to cook the top.,1
This recipe was made for a group of 120 in a commercial kitchen.  We substituted whole wheat flour for half of the flour it calls for.  The rolls turned out wonderful!  Very delicious and easy,1
WOO HOO I did it with the help from my fellow foodies support. These were wonderful. I divided the recipe as there is only two of us. I made croissants for dinner. Then I made Cinnamon Roll,1
"These are great! Not a croissant, but much lighter than an average roll. I have made them 4 times now, and they are fairly ""fool-proof"", as I have made mistakes (letting them sit too long)",1
made these in my bread machine as well and they turned out great. I will definitely be making these often my four boys gobble them up fast.,1
I have tried many roll recipes on this site and others and this is without a doubt my favorite. My 5 year old rated it as such 5 fingers plus one thumb on the other hand so it gets 6 stars !,1
This recipe completely impressed my in laws (which is not easily done). My MIL is an extremely good cook and she even gave me compliments ! I use half the recipe and made crescent rolls,1
"They are good rolls, but they do not taste like croissants they are like normal rolls and not flaky. They look nice though.",1
These rolls were VERY good and VERY easy to make! I brushed a little egg white on top of each roll which added a nice brownness. They were a hit at my family Christmas party.,1
Made this tonight and what a huge hit with my family! The only change I made was to add in one pint of heavy whipping cream and four cans clams instead of three. I also used Krusteaz gluten free...,1
Excellent! Used the recipe to make appetizers for the super bowl... Worked wonderfully!,1
"Wonderful rolls!  I made them for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them.  I shaped half of the dough into the crescent rolls and the other half I rolled out, coated with softened butter.",1
"This was so simple. If you have a bread maker use the dough/pizza dough setting. I just dumped all 4 cups of flour, sugar, salt, softened butter, eggs and shortening into the bread machine bowl.",1
I think this is the first recipe I have rated all five stars. It is AMAZING! I picked all the ingredients into my bread machine to make the dough and it could not have been easier.,1
This is very similar to our family recipe. Only diff is that we use butter instead of shortening and 1/2 cup each of milk and water. We bake at a lower temp.,1
"I was dubious at first because that is a LOT of yeast in a little bit of water, but I committed myself not to change things. The recipe doesn't say how long to knead.",0
"I was concerned when this dough more resembled cookie dough than bread dough, and then again when it did not rise during the first hour. I went ahead and rolled it out.",0
"Yum yum, I halved the recipe and it made 12 crescents that looked like they were on steroids! I did make them in my bread machine but I proof the yeast with the water and 1 T of the sugar.",1
"These taste really good, but they do not rise very well for me. I have tried three times and just not that impressed.  Maybe the salt ratio is off or something?.",0
"Great, with a light texture, and slightly sweet taste.  I adjusted the recipe only to start the dough in a bread maker.  And I did have to let it rise.",1
Fantastic dough! I did modify it to use rapid rise yeast every time I have made it. I really like it with a little oatmeal to replace some of the flour and half of the sugar replaced with honey.,1
"Be warned this is a very rich dough recipe for rolls, not for anybody on a diet. I only used a small amount of butter to coat dough before rolling and skipped brushing them with melted butter.",0
"This recipe was easy fun and just plain great I rolled small sausages and cheese in them then backed like it says and they were wonderful, makes an on the run meal.",1
"Sooooo good! I love these with honey butter. I like to rewarm them by covering with a damp paper towel  and putting them in a 275 oven until the towel is dry, it help them to have that fresh.",1
"VERY GOOD!! Although the name implies that these are just like crescents, the submitter warns you that they are more dense. So you must expect that before starting this recipe.",1
"I read through several reviews and did not see this point covered. It is a tasty recipe, but rolling them out to 12 inch circles left my crescent rolls thick more roll",1
"While home for the holidays, the family requested I make crescent rolls for Christmas dinner, which I had not made before. This recipe was incredibly easy and tasty. I made 30 rolls for 5 people.",1
"Very good, not like the ones in the can at the store. soft, chewy, and delicious! I accidentally ended up letting mine rise for almost 2 hours, and they were HUGE! I made garlic butter.",1
These were good rolls-very nice at Thanksgiving.,1
Good rolls but not crescent rolls,1
these were the best part of my Thanksgiving dinner this year. SO much better than the kind you buy in the tube at the grocer.,1
"These were marvelous! I made a few minor changes, I used half the sugar, and I only put in 3 1/2 cups of flour in the dough. My husband really loved them, he ate three letter after dinner.",1
Awesome rolls!!!!,1
Excellent recipe!  I did not change a thing.  My family loves these!,1
It took much longer to rise than the recipe states. It has been 5 hours and is close to doubled. They were the best part of the meal!,1
"We loved this!  They were soft, buttery rolls, and my husband really enjoyed them with strawberry jam.  The only changes I made were to sub 1/2 of the flour for whole wheat.",1
"Amazing! I have gone with all white flour, I have also done 50/50 with whole wheat and again amazing results!",1
"This is a good dinner roll light and fluffy, but NOT a croissant! I brushed egg on the rolls before putting them in the oven for a more golden color. I used canola oil for the shortening.",1
"I used this recipe in my bread machine on dough setting, changing the order of ingredients to match the manufacturer's directions. Even though I was 40 minutes late getting home",1
"I cut the recipe in half, split into 24 pieces and wrapped them around cocktail weiners.  Kids loved them!  And, I admit, so did I.",1
These were so easy to make and came out great my family loved them!,1
Awesome! I made half of them into crescent rolls and the other half into mini cinnamon rolls. Both are delicious right out of the oven.,1
"I never actually made this into rolls.  When I make this, I just use the dough for other things after it has raised the first time.  I have used it as the crust for a breakfast pizza.",0
"Wow! The taste and texture of this dough is amazing! Of course, instead of following the recipe perfectly I changed it a bit. I used 3 and 1/2 cups of white whole wheat flour.",1
I am looking for a good recipe for some kind of homemade roll to make for Thanksgiving this year and I think this may be it.  I made half a batch for my husband and I today to try them out.,1
"While not said in directions, use your pizza cutter to cut your rolls.",0
"A tip from my mother in law years ago on this type roll. keep this dough really soft, do not add",0
Best rolls that I have ever had.  These are constantly being requested. They are one of my specialties now.,1
"Very good. I agree with another reviewer that says that it needs more time to rise. Also, I did brush it with egg whites in order to make it more flaky. These taste much better than store",1
"I am Learning to cook/bake with that said what I am I doing wrong, I had my water temp at 105 degrees I added a teaspoon of sugar and my yeast , it double in size and foamed.",0
Excellent! I had only one pkg of yeast do I dissolve it in 2 tablespoons of warm water 110 degrees with a tablespoon of sugar. I let that sit until it was foamy on top.,1
"came out really well. once you make once, very versatile to add jalapeno, cheese, or anything. These are crescent rolls, not croissant rolls.",1
A similar recipe has been made in my family for over 50 years! ,1
"Absolutely nothing like store bought crescent rolls, but still very, very good!  A sweet yeast roll.",1
These were fantastic! Like most other reviewers I used 1/2 cup of butter instead of the shortening. I also left out the additional 1/4 cup of butter at the end because I figured 1/2 cup was plen.,1
OHHH YEAH! These are GREAT!! Very easy to make and always a big hit. I took others advice and let rise another hour.,1
These were a big hit at Thanksgiving. On one batch I sprinkled some parmesan cheese before I rolled them up. DELICIOUS!!!  I will definitely be keeping these around!,1
"Made these rolls for our chicken packets. I have always bought the crescent rolls for this dish, but decided to try my hand at homemade rolls this time. They were so good!! These rolls are so easy.",1
Used this recipe in my bread maker turned wonderfully! I only had one envelope of yeast and they still made HUGE crescents! I made them into garlic herb crescents by adding some oregano basil.,1
Excellent rolls. the key is letting them rise for a lot more  time before and after you roll them out!!! I turn my oven down too.,1
"These are great tasting and easy, my only problem is that I had to lower the oven temperature or the bottoms were burnt. Everyone loved them and asked for the recipe!",1
"I followed the recipe exactly. I am not sure why, but my dough never raised. I make homemade breads all the time and do not have this problem, but this dough was rather dense. It did not raise.",0
"These were a great change from regular buns. Made dough in KA, next time I will add flour slowly, could get by with 1/2 cup less.",0
This dough is fabulous to work with. I used it for pepperoni roll and it was a big hit.,1
The rolls I made did not turn out at all. If I could I would give it zero stars.,0
This is my go to recipe when company shows up very quick and easy and I usually have all the ingredients on hand. I use about 1/4 cup sugar in this dough and roll a cocktail hot dog.,1
"I was so excited to find this recipe!  These rolls have been a Thanksgiving tradition for as long as I can remember, in fact they are right up there with the turkey for must haves!",1
"This recipes is such a quick and easy recipe for a light, buttery melt in your mouth roll.  My family just loves these rolls.  If get an early afternoon I can put together a batch for dinner.",1
"These are awesome!!!!! I let mine raise for 7 hours and they turned out to be very fluffy. My family loved them. When they were hot we sliced them open and put scrambled eggs, ham.",1
These are easy to make and have great flavor but they need much more time to raise. They turned out pretty dense. Also I would brush them with/ a beaten egg before baking to attain a golden/brown.,1
"Very close to an old dinner roll recipe from the 40's a little richer, sweeter and with water vs. milk. Results were quite good.",1
This is very good!  I did not make it into crescent rolls,1
Wow.  This was the first time I have had rolls turn out light & fluffy.  Hooray for that!  ,1
Delicious!  The bacon from other reviews is a must.  I also added ground thyme to my flour mixture.,1
"Fantastic! Just a tip. Out the dough in the oven to rise after turning it on for one minute, just to warm up the air inside. It makes the dough rise much faster.",1
"The rolls were moist and had a nice crunch on the outside. I would make this again, maybe even do crescent dogs.",1
"I LOVEEEEEE this recipe, make it last night for my birthday and everyone was amazed! The roll was very soft, much softer than a dinner roll. I left mine to rise for about an hour and a half.",1
These were pretty tasty.  I made the first batch from scratch and they came out very dense but that could be because my boyfriend got nosy during the rise process.,1
"Oh my gosh these are the best rolls ever !!! I was a little worried at first because the dough was a little dense, thought it was too much yeast, but they turned out terrific.",1
Love the Crescent Rolls! Very easy to make and they taste great.,1
"Perfect light bread. Great for pizzas, rolls, garlic bread and much much more!",1
These crescent rolls are so very good. I would definitely make them again. Made 24 so have some to freeze for later. They did not take very long to make either.,1
So yummy and soft and flaky on the inside!  Reminds me of the inside of the Pillsbury Flaky Biscuits.  I wanted something that really was a crescent roll.,1
These are pretty good. A great side for dinner!,1
"So good, yet so easy!  I followed the recipe and brushed on extra butter when I took the rolls out. Yummy!",1
"Yummy! I also have used this recipe for breakfast and added cranberries, cinnamon and brown sugar before rolling up the crescents!",1
I have made this several times now and it is my go to recipe for crescent rolls.  I use my bread machine and substitute butter for the shortening.  It also makes great cinnamon rolls.,1
My husband loves this recipe. I have also made it with wheat flour and the rolls turned out wonderful and they are so easy to make. The only thing I do different is put it in a bread machine.,1
"oh what can i say about this recipe? its fool proof. i have messed it up adding double the shortening, replacing shortening with olive oil. for me it rises within half an hour. i have put garlic",0
"these were fantastic and I agree with the other reviewer, a great place to start for first time yeast users. I will make them again for sure!  Wish I had this recipe years ago.",1
"This is a great recipe, that I have been making for the last two years. As other bakers have suggested, I have decreased the baking time on this recipe. I baked my crescents at 350 for 12 minute",1
"I mixed the ingredients in my bread machine, however, I use Crisco for the shortening and it did NOT mix in with the dough. next time I will try melting it first. These rolls rose very nicely.",1
"These are super! I wrap them around hot dogs and bake them in the oven, and they work SO well for that. They are good plain too!",1
"They were delicious, but i added a hint of salt",1
I was tired of spending money on grocery store crescent rolls so I went looking for a recipe to make at home. This was the first and last recipe I will try. They were easy and turned out,1
"I made these since I was out of potatoes and could not make my favorite Colleen's Potato Crescent Rolls from this site. I still prefer the potato crescents, but these are pretty good.",1
I love to make bread and have tried many recipes. This is at the top!! So flaky and tasty. Will definitely use this as my most common bread to make.,1
"I wanted a dough for pigs in a blanket that did not come from a can and I was very impressed with this! I use half butter, half shortening and put the dough in the oven to rise",1
Completely wonderful! I was going to use a different recipe til I found I was short on eggs. Only had one egg to use and no shortening. Used a pastry blender.,1
These were a delight. I was so busy when I made it that I just let them rise for longer than stated but it was just fine. Excellent. I am not sure that it makes it better or not to sit rising,1
"Made according to the recipe. The taste was fantastic, the kids enjoyed them fresh and reheated the next day.  They were not as fluffy as I would have liked. I will make them again.",1
"This turned out great. I used the dough for the veggie pizza on this site instead of the canned crescent dough. The only changes I made were that I halved it, use butter instead of shortening.",1
"Simple and Perfect. I am glad I did not halve the recipe, as these turned out so good we keep going back for more. It had been a while since I baked yeast breads, so after a quick refresher course",1
THESE WERE VERY GOOD! I MADE THEM INTO CINNAMON ROLLS. ROLLED THEM OUT BRUSHED WITH BUTTER BROWN SUGAR CINNAMON AND SUGAR AND ROLLED UP AND CUT INTO ROLLS. LET RISE AGAIN. AND BAKED!,1
"I am not sure if it was due to the metric converter, but i needed a lot more flour. Otherwise these were ok. I had to freeze half of the dough and it thawed beautifully.",0
YES!! These are so good and I made some stuffed with sausage and cheese.,1
"These are really good and easy to make. The dough took longer to rise for some reason. Also, I baked them for 15 minutes and they were golden brown on top but the bottoms were overdone.",1
My family ask for these dinner rolls with the holiday meals. They are just as good after being frozen.,1
I found this recipe last month and have made them 2 times already.  This was my first time actually making bread so I was a bit nervous.  They are easy and delicious.  Big hit with everyone!,1
Made these and took some to husband's family. Big hit. Great with honey butter! If you like buttery rolls this is it. Also super easy.,1
"Absolutely wonderful. Easy, versatile. It is now my favorite recipe for dinner rolls and also for any of the sweet breads I make, like cinnamon honey.",1
These are awesome! Make sure you add ALL the sugar in the recipe. It would not come out right unless you do.,1
Best crescent rolls ever.  I do not let them rise much a second time and they are superb. Very easy to make.,1
"i think i am one of the few people who did not really like these. they were too sweet and very dense, the dough didn't rise well for me but that is probably not the fault of the recipe.",0
"These are the easiest, lightest, tastiest rolls I have ever made. My family can not stop talking about them or eating them!!",1
I made these crescent rolls for Christmas this year and was quite surprised! I was a little worried when the dough did not rise as much as I thought it would (considering the two packets of yeast),1
i did not use the specified name brand products just off the shelf sugar and other ingredients but i do use real butter when making them!,0
"This was my first attempt at clam chowder. I too added bacon like the others had recommended. I love this recipe, and I will be using this every time I make clam chowder",1
"This was good, easy. I used heavy cream and a low carb thickener. Added chicken stock instead of water. I would have added clam juice had I had it and bigger clams.",1
The recipe was great. I did make a few changes based on other comments. I precooked the potatoes. I added a bottle of clam juice instead of water. I added a seafood blend from Costco.,1
"This is tasty WITH a FEW modifications. You have to, to ones taste. I added chicken bouillon cubes to my water. Used the bacon grease with the clam juice. Used a bit of cornstarch at the end",1
"turned out pretty good! Still had a little bit of the yeasty flavor so I will add more butter next time, but overall these were a winner with my family. They puffed up quite large",1
for those of you wanting a more croissant like roll. you have to add another 1 cup of butter sliced up and kind of chunky then work the layers.,0
"Mine raised fine, but they were dinner rolls and not flaky pastry like rolls",0
"I have made these several times recently, and they always turn out beautifully. Tonight I used the dough to make cinnamon rolls!! I may need some help",1
Light and delicious! Perfect for company dinners.  But be sure and keep an eye on them during baking,1
very good and easy,1
Very Good!  I have baked rolls for 50 years. Crescent rolls refer to the way they are rolled.  You can make crescent rolls with any roll dough that is shaped ,1
I love this recipe !!! Was wondering can I prepare this like always let rise and just refrigerate the dough till ready to make later ? I like making pigs in blanket with these too,1
"These are a homemade version of pillsbury's crescent. Super easy to make, I made a half recipe and I used the dough to do sausage roll. A great hit with my husband.",1
Wonderful bread recipe! I turned the heat down to 350 degrees and cooked the rolls for approximately twelve minutes. I will make these again and again!,1
I have never had much luck with bread but decided to give this a try. I cut the recipe in half. I let it rise for about 2 hours the first time and I think it wound up being about an hour the second,0
"Amazing every time. Make sure you do have a definite warm spot though, or they will not rise. It is a great recipe for your first time making bread from scratch.",1
Have been making these delicious rolls for several years. I always use butter rather than shortening.,1
"I made the dough for these in the bread machine then rolled them out into two pies, cutting each into 8 pie pieces.  My children wanted cheese in them.  So, we rolled some sliced cheddar",1
I love this recipe. I use this recipe to make pepperoni rolls. My family loves them!,1
Came out perfect. Thanks a lot. I did half cinnamon rolls. It worked great.,1
My mom has used this recipe for years. We get requests to take them everywhere. The original recipe (Lowell Inn Crescent Rolls) uses 4 cups sifted flour. We never sifted do,1
"These were awesome when they cam out, and still amazing a few days later (stored of course). Could not ask for a better recipe!",1
"These turned out pretty decent. better than the ones you buy in the store. this is a great recipe, however I am still not a huge fan of crescent rolls because they are a fat heavy bread",1
"I made these tonite! Came out great! Nice flavor, more of a dinner roll but very good results and easy to make! Good recipe",1
I would give these crescent rolls a 10 if I could. They are the best. Followed the recipe to the letter. Thank you for posting this recipe. Definitely a favorite.,1
"I used my yeast straight out of the freezer and after 2 hours, the dough had only begun to rise. I left it while i went to church, came back three hours later, and it has doubled. I was relieved",1
"Good rolls, but not crescent.",1
I am going to rate this exclusively based on the 3/4 cups of flour. Even 2 Tbs of flour is unnecessary. You should be doing a slight mash of the potatoes after they are cooked,0
"This is a great recipe, but it is basically a really good dinner roll in the shape of a crescent roll. It is much denser and darker than what you might expect. But if you are looking for a thick",1
"Awesome! Light, flaky, exactly what I wanted! Grew up with these for every holiday, and this was my first time making them myself. Total win!",1
I made these with half wheat and they were yummy.,1
Totally AWESOME rolls! My first time baking bread and they were so easy. I was afraid I had done something wrong when they did not seem to rise. I punched them down and let them rise once more,1
"really a 4.5 stars. the only thing was mine were very brown after only 9 mins. I made this with my 3yr old has a weekend activity. the yeast, the punching and the rolling were all lots of fun",1
"Too funny, I have been making this exact recipe for 40 years, my mother got it from a cousin 60 years ago. I make it several times a week.",1
these are so good,1
"Yummy! This was my first attempt at crescent rolls. They turned out delicious.  I used my bread machine to make them, and used half of the dough to make cinnamon rolls. The dough was so easy",1
I used this recipe for a top and bottom crust for a Hoagie Bake on allrecipes. I used a portion of wheat flour. It tastes amazing.,1
"My kids LOVE these. They even request them. I even forgot to butter them, and no one noticed. I want to try mixing melted butter and honey then spreading on top just before they are done to see",1
OMG just made these and they turned out beautiful.  Very light and buttery. A saver for sure great recipe,1
"I thought these were excellent. I used a 5/16 oz packet of dry active yeast and followed the recipe for everything else. Only difference is,I did not allow the second rising",1
I used 1/2 c of butter instead worked great!,0
These were truly very easy. They rose beautifully and and were yummy. My kids ate them up!  Definitely worth the effort of homemade,1
Fabulous!! Awesome!! I used this recipe to make homemade rolls for the first time. turned out perfectly!! The only modification I made is I use softened butter in place of the shortening.,1
"These are SO GOOD, but I have not made them in a while, and was going to make them again today. Has anyone else noticed that the recipe calls for a stick of butter",1
"WONDERFUL recipe!! Best dinner rolls I have ever made. And they freeze really well too! Better than any I be tried. I made half a recipe and freeze half, but now I wish I would made the whole recipe.",1
These are excellent! I substitute butter for the shortening and used my bread machine to make the dough,1
Yum! I mixed in the bread machine on dough cycle. Very easy dough to handle. I also followed recommendations and let rise for two hours before baking. Make sure to tuck the point way under,1
Followed recipe exactly. Next time I would use 1/2 shortening and 1/2 butter. The recipe was extremely easy to make. I just rolled dough out into as much of a circle I could.,1
Very good,1
I like that the dough is a bit heavier. It is still flaky and very good. I served them with honey butter and raspberry jam. Excellent recipe!,1
my kids absolutely love them,1
i used this recipe to make pigs in a blanket and they were pretty good.,1
"Crescents, NOT Croissants!! Don't be confused. They are nothing like Croissants. These were very good with a touch of sweetness. Served with jam and cheese sweet and savory Both delicious!'",1
"These were great and easy to make. I am going to make cinnamon rolls this time too. and I did use 1/2 whole grain. Really light and airy, my 6 year old loves them.",1
"This was excellent! I make several batches of bread each week, and this is one of my new best recipes! My husband nearly ate the entire batch! Did Not change a thing",1
These were perfect and so easy! I had a recipe that calls for canned crescent roll dough but did not have any on hand. I had to add a little extra flour to the dough to get the right consistency,1
"THIS RECIPE IS SO DELICIOUS AND EASY TO MAKE. I HAVE USED IT FOR JUST REGULAR CRESCENTS AND I HAVE ALSO STUFFED IT WITH EITHER MEATS, CHEESES OR DIFFERENT PIE FILLINGS.",1
"Way too dense, although it had a good flavor fresh from the oven, it was a crumbly mess when reheated. Will not make again.",0
"This was a great, simple recipe. They were so good. I have always brought the ones from the store, I know bad me. These were delicious. My son the bread hound absolutely loved these",1
"Perfect the 1st time, now that is awesome!",1
"I did not make these entirely, as I made the dough to use for the chicken broccoli braid, so I made the dough in my breadmaker, let it rise, then rolled it out for the braid.",1
looks like this is one successful bread recipe! i wrapped strips of bacon and cheese inside. yum yum.,1
"AWESOME recipe! Not only was this my first time making any type of bread from scratch, it was for Thanksgiving dinner! The rolls turned out so yummy!",1
I love this recipe! I made the rolls and my husband said that they were better than the canned. Thank you!,1
"Golden, beautiful, perfect!",1
My family raved about these. I have had a hard time finding a roll that I can make that is nice and fluffy. These were perfect. The dough was very easy to roll out and work with.,1
Delicious! I used it for chicken and broccoli braid a great recipe!,1
"I made and reviewed this recipe a couple years ago. The rolls turned out a little dense, but very tasty. I made them again for our Christmas dinner this year. I used half the dough for cinnamon",1
"I love love love love these rolls! So yummy! And, so simple to make. Buttery and delicious!",1
This was my first attempt at making fresh rolls and they came out excellent. The yeast flavor really comes out and makes the roll.,1
My family loved these! They said it reminded them of Ryan's or Golden Corral's rolls just slather on some honey butter and good to go!,1
"I have been making these rolls for a long time now. I did not get to rating them until now. But they are the best! People ALWAYS ask for me to bring them, or make them! I HIGHLY recommend this easy",1
"Easy, no fuss recipe. The dough is easy to roll out and work with, and you only have to let it rise once!",1
"These rolls were alright. They tasted fine, but nothing out of this world. The recipe worked great, I had no problems making them, they baked up just fine, but it seemed like a lot of work",1
"These were great! I have tried many times to make rolls and always they come out yeasty tasting or hard, but these were perfect. I let them rise about 1 hr more than the recipe called",1
"Like all bread, these were time consuming. Pretty easy overall and the taste was pretty good. Not spectacular, and maybe not worth the effort but okay.",1
Very good rolls. I made two batches for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them. They also reheat well. I made the recommended Cinnamon Honey butter,1
"Not that this needs another great review but it was such a success, that I have to chime in. I used 1 Tbsp of brown sugar to proof the yeast (1pkt) and added some parm cheese, garlic and onion",1
"This was good had for lunch, we made a cheese bread instead of using red sauce and other toppings, but I think I prefer my other fav pizza dough recipe. I just like the proportions better",1
This is a fantastic recipe! I just added a 1/2 tsp of garlic powder. I used my Kitchen Aid with the bread hook to mix at a 2 speed for two minutes and then at a 6 speed for eight minutes.,1
"Since this has received so many good reviews, I am going to hope that my just so so results were due to user error and not the recipe. I had to add a lot more flour to the mixture",0
The texture of this pizza crust is very good and was my favorite until I tried Ricardo's from this site (it is the best I have ever had). I would say this definitely makes 2 large crusts though,1
This was very good but I made a few alterations Like some others I took the oil down to 1/4c ,1
I do not  know why my kids did not like this one I thought it was very moist and delicious,1
This one is a keeper I added a 1/4 tsp nutmeg and a dash of allspice and had great results This is a recipe you can mix up while you are doing ten other things because it is so foolproof,1
This recipe was very easy to make I made it with canned apple pie filling instead of applesauce,1
What a delicious bread I also added of nutmeg and allspice I think it enhanced the flavors,1
I added more cinnamon and a bit of cardamom and I had to omit the sour cream completely since I di,1
I made muffins that turned out yum I used brown vs whiter sugar since I did not  have enough white sugar to make them at the time I usedplain yogurt vs sour cream since I did not have enough so,1
Delicious Perfect I halved the recipe and used a tad bit more flour than the recipe asked for since I heard some people,1
Very light in in texture,0
This bread is delicious I used 1/2 c oil vanilla yogurt instead of sour cream and added one tsp ,1
AWESOME This is a new family favorite I did add a bit of salt to the recipe and even used ,1
nice and moist Not real sweet which would not be a downfall Next time i might add the nutmeg and so.,1
I love quick breads and this one is an excellent recipe I did not think I would find a bread my,1
This is an excellent recipe I made mini-muffins instead of two loaves and they turned out great,1
I made this bread and it turned out awesome even tho I made the mistake adding 1 c. of sourcream in,1
easy easy easy We all loved it and especially KJ who at 3 slices at 19 months old Will make again,1
I needed to use up a ton of applesauce and made this bread not expecting much but boy was I wrong,1
Perfect I followed the recipe exactly with raisins Would not change anything,1
This is a great starter I cut the oil by 1/4cup and added 1 tsp of orange zest and doubled the cinnamon,1
This recipe was very good I cut down the oil to about 3/4 cup added 1 chopped apple to give it so,1
This bread was okay not anything special I ended up throwing the second loaf out after I had frozen,1
I subbed blueberry yogurt for the sour cream doubled the cinnamon used half brown sugar half white,1
Great recipe I used unsweetened applesauce and added some chopped up apples it was great,1
Definitely a keeper but I made some changes that I think would make for a healthier loaf I reduce,1
I made four batches of this bread at once in small loaves 6 per recipe for Rosh HaShanah gifts,1
It was really good and definitely sweet enough for me and I did not use the full amount of sugar,1
Very good quick bread I added a little extra cinnamon and suspect some vanilla would be very good,1
This bread tasted wonderful Extremely mois Easy to make I will be making this again,1
I have a hard to please family and this is something everyone enjoyed even my little sister and he,1
Everyone loved it,1

Very good rolls.  I made two batches for Thanksgiving and everyone loved them.  They also reheat well.  I made the recommended Cinnamon Honey butter (from this site) and it was the perfect pair,1
Thankyou so much!! ,1
It was so easy and perfect for my tuna stuffers!,1
"I'm living in France right now and the French mother and grandmother were both asking me for the recipes for the croissants, and I found that it was a delicious recipe.",1
Very nice recipe. To make the rolls a little lighter and fluffier,1
Wow this recipe was very easy and delicious.  I received many compliments and my guests begged for more.,1
Amazingly delicious,1
Easy to make,1
Was hoping that these would turn out like my mother-in-law made long ago. They are good but lighter than hers were. Good with butter spread on them. Had them at Thanksgiving.,0
Bea-uti-ful!,1
Amazing dough and great tasting!,1
I loved it. I reduced the recipe to half. I actually left the first rise overnight. The second I left it for almost two hours. The results were astounding.,1
Best recipe I have EVER made and I have made a lot of bread! I turned mine into cinnamon rolls. I used bread flour and they are so soft,1
Not really like a traditional crescent roll. Similar in texture and taste to a butter roll. Still very good. Next time I plan to put a lot of butter in the roll.,1
Very good crescents.  I added a little more flour while it was coming together/kneading because it was really sticking to the bowl,1
This dough is really simple to make and comes out with a great texture. I used it for pigs in a blanket and cinnamon rolls. It was delicious in both!,1
The recipe was easy to follow. Love making homemade breads for my family. We are going to make larger next time to make sandwiches out of them.,1
Easy very good.,1
I haven't made these yet although they look really easy. I just have one question; can I freeze part of the dough to use another time? There''s only just the two of us and that looks like it mak...',1
I followed the recipe exactly and they turned out very dense and bland. If I made these again I would add some butter and garlic salt to the dough and maybe some other seasonings as well.,1
This is the recipe that I' 've been looking for they came out perfect just like my mom's!!!,1
I followed the instructions but they did not turn out very well. I felt like it was too doughy still.,0
Besides the cooking time is about 3 minutes too long these are wonderful.  Easy relatively quick light  fluffy. Family loves them!,1

Very tasty! I choose to reduce the oven temperature to 350. The tops however did not get very golden brown.,1
I used this recipe to make pizza pinwheels. I reduced the sugar to 1/3 cup as well as the butter and the salt to 1/2 tsp because the filling I used was Parmesan Mozzarella and pepperoni.,1
I have made a lot of different recipes for rolls. This was the best! The dough was wonderful to work with. After reading several reviews I decided to reduce the heat to 350. Highly recommend.,1
"I had to add more flour after the recipe amount to make the dough manageable to knead and additional flour to knead.  All together I use about 5  1/2 cups, not 4.",0
I thought that these crescent rolls were amazing. The only thing I would change would be the cooking time to 5 or seven minutes.,1
Ommmmmm num num num!!!! These are soooooooo good. Terrible for the waistline though because all you want to do is eat them. I also like to throw all the ingredients in my bread machine on dough ...',1
I have made this quite a few times and here are a few tips that always work for me: never use off-brand (grocery store brand or generic) bread yeast. Fleishman's is what I use or King Arthur.,1
"I may have kneaded this a bit much and added about 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour. At any rate, the taste was good but they were dense and a bit tough",1
I love this recipe I have been using it for years it tastes just like the rolls my mom makes for Thanksgiving dinner since I live across the country from her it's nice to have something on Thanksgiving.,1
"A family favorite every Thanksgiving for > 50 years. Originally brought to us by a family friend hence known to our family as ""Uncle Artie''s Rolls.",1
These tasted really good but they didn't rise very well.,1
I absolutely love this recipe! The rolls come out soft buttery and delicious! I will definitely be making these rolls for the next Thanksgiving gathering.,1
Make this recipe a lot! These are very nice to take to a holiday dinner I never have any to bring home. Easy and yummy!! ,1
They had no flavor. I let them rise for 4 hours total and they were still so dense. They didn't taste like anything except dense greasy bread. I tried putting honey on one and peanut butter on but still no tasty,0
This was a good recipe. Very soft and pliable dough. I thought it much denser than canned crescent dough but I''d prefer that way. I did not use quite 4 cups of flour.,1
I made half the recipe. Used bread flour. Added egg after initial cup of flour. Only baked for 10 minutes. Used dough to make 12 resurrection rolls. Skipped,0
Fabulous! Theses are super easy to make using the dough setting on my bread maker.  They are the best rolls I have ever made.,1
I will certainly be making these again. Instead of using 1/2 cup of sugar I used 1/2 a cup of honey and just added more flour to compensate for the honey being a wet ingredient.,1
I have a small food business and I love to cook. I REALLY love to bake tho. A very simple recipe and easy to pull off. I cook with kosher-style salt and always add more than the recipe states.,1
The perfect way to start... Awesome output even I was shocked. The only thing we can add up to this is we can stuff in ,1
I made these for Thanksgiving and again for Christmas and everyone loved them! I don't know why people are saying they substituted the shortening because the recipe says nothing at all about u.,1

Made it for Christmas Eve just now. These are sooo good. My family is just loving them. I didn't change a thing and will certainly make it a holiday tradition.',1
These rolls are very nice Like dense egg bread nothing like croissants.,1
I followed the recipe exactly and thought they came out very good. The flavor was excellent nice a fluffy too. The only reason I gave it a 4 was that it took a lot of time but I'll definitely use it,1
This was very yummy and pretty.  I would like it to be more dense or maybe more buttery.  I will tweak it a bit but I loved it overall.,1
Too sweet.  Denser than I expected. Will try again with less sugar.,1

Very moist bread.  The whole family enjoyed it!,1
Yummy!  Love this bread just as it is in the recipe.,1
Very sweet even without the glaze but made exactly as directed and was so good. More like a dessert but yummy for sure.  A small slice goes a long way.,1
This recipe is very good it sure didn''t last long around our house. I think the glaze adds the extra special touch to this bread. I like the suggestion of using a pastry brush to apply the glaze.,1
Great recipe I would definitely make it again.  I made mini  loaves and baked them for 1 hour next time I will only bake for 50 minutes.,1
I've made this twice and absolutely love it! I only used half of the frosting and it came out delicious. It''s a family favorite and I''m even taking it to ,1
I was just about to submit this same exact recipe!! The amount of poppy seeds can be adjusted - I tripled the amount and it tasted great.,1
I wish I had taken a photo of this bread.  I will next time - it was so perfect in the pan and really turned out beautifully.  My family went nuts over it. I prepared ,1
Great poppyseed bread... I didn''t have the butter flavored extract so I used extra almond extract.. I also subbed whole wheat flour for 1/3 of the flour which didn''t seem to effect it much.,1
I halved the recipe and filled 3 min-loaf pans which baked for 40 min. I have a hot oven.  I substituted 3/4 c. coconut milk for the cows milk in this recipe and used soy milk for the remainder.,0
THIS BREAD IS AMAZING!!!! Moin xxxx,1
My children loved this but they love anything with sugar and poppy seeds.  It was very sweet and moist but it had a greasy feel to it so I couldn''t eat it.,1
I thought this was terrible. All I could taste was the oil. You could even smell the oil while it was baking. If your going to try this I would substitute the oil with something else.,0
I gave this bread to several of my friends for Christmas.  Everyone wanted the recipe and that is the best compliment.  Thank you for another 5 star to add to my collection!,1
It was great! I added a little orange zest in the glaze and I loved it!,1
LOVE! I made it in a bundt pan and it was beautiful. I made the glaze a lot thicker but that''s the only tweak.,1
No glaze necessary! This is a moist delicious cakelike bread with a wonderfully crispy exterior. I didn't use the butter flavoring and it was no problem. Yum!,1
I have made this recipe every year for more than 15 years. It is always a hit and my son in law always makes sure I make it at Christmas for him.,1
Oh I am addicted to this bread!  I make it so I can have it for breakfast during the week.  I am not a bread person but this is really the best I have ever tasted.  Great as muffins also!,1
Aaaaah-mazing!,1
Recipe is great as written. Great flavor and texture. Very moist. This was my first time baking with poppy seed and it was the perfect recipe. Next time I will add more poppy seed.,1
My family loves this recipe! It tastes more like a cake or a cake donut in my opinion. It's very dense and delicious. Whenever I''ve shared it with friends they always ask for the recipe.,1
Best sweet bread ever!!,1
This poppy seed bread is delicious!  It was great teacher gifts this past Christmas and my children keep asking for it!  Thank you!,1
This bread is moist and very good the butter extract adds the  butter flavor without the added fat; in my opinion it is not necessary. If I make it again I might try cutting the oil down.,1
YUM!!!  This is more a cake than a bread.  Not too heavy and not too sweet. I made on 9x5 loaf and one 8x4 in the same amount of baking time.,1
Very easy to make and taste really good!!  I substitute all oil with apple sauce for the first time and it turned out too tough in texture.,1
EXACTLY what i was looing for.  i made mine without the glaze and the bread is so delicious!!  very comparable to jumbo almond poppy seed muffins that a local bakery makes.  my family loves it.,1
This was the first time that i made this bread i did add the zest and juice of one lemon it came out great.,1
Absolutely delicious and easy. Tastes just like those coffee shop muffins...yum :) I think next time I will try the glaze with lemon juice instead of orange.,1
Delicious! Almost tasted like a glazed old-fashioned donut. I will absolutely make this again.,1
This bread is very good. I made it for the first time last night and my whole family loved it. I cut the recipe in half but other than that followed it exactly.,1
everyone absolutely loved this bread. second time i made it i did a loaf without the icing because they complained that it was too sweet. but i think the icing really makes this bread.,1
This recipe is AMAZING! My favorite sweet bread on the site! The only change I made was 1/3 cup applesauce and 1 cup oil. I though the glaze made it extra sweet moist and delicious.,1
Very good bread. They are a little sweeter than I would like so I omitted the glaze on a couple of the loaves I made.,1
Wow...delicious!!! I would give it ten stars too if I could (as per another reviewer)! This is the exact same recipe as Poppy Seed Bread.,1
Really good!  The edges were burnt by the time the middle was done though. Still the final product was delicious!,1
perfect bread.  Didn''t change a thing.  It''s a keeper. 10 stars if I could rate it higher. Thanks,1
So incredibly delicious!  I made mine in loaf pans because the recipe states that it''s bread.  Easily would be passed off as a cake if made in a bundt pan.  The glaze is VERY sweet.,1
I made this today and it tastes great.  However I had to bake it a little longer in order to get the center done which I think dried it out a bit.,1
I lowered the sugar just by about 1/4 then my roommate and I ate both loaves pretty much all by ourselves.  Delicious but I should go run a few miles now!,1
This is a great recipe!  I made four mini loaves but will probably make three next time because they were a little small.  The flavor is a wonderful combination.,1
This bread is absolutely wonderful.  I split the recipe using half of all the ingredients and two eggs with no problems.,1
I halve the ingredients to make one 9x5 loaf. I use 1/4 c. oil and 2/3 c. sugar to reduce the fat content. Added 1 c. walnuts. I''ve baked this for friends and gotten rave reviews. Thanks for this recipe.,1
Use 1/2 cup of oil - still VERY moist & delicious.  Easy to put together.  I made one loaf & used the rest to make muffins.  Muffins took less time to bake (about 30 min.),1
Great recipe.  Everyone at work loved it.  Made some changes: Used only 1/2 cup oil 1/2 tsp. cinnamon added 1/4 tsp. each nutmeg and ginger.,1
I left out the oil entirely and the bread was still very moist!  I used craisins and walnuts but still felt a bit more flavor was needed.,0
I made a dozen muffins (I used a non-stick pan omitted the grease and flour and just lifted them out with a plastic knife).  I was out of sour cream so just used skim milk instead,1
I was really excited about making this bread after all the great reviews but it definitely didn''t work for me!  I made it for a bunch of my friends but I was very disappointed.,0
I really liked this bread. I didn''t use raisins and instead of applesauce I used homemade pear-applesauce.  I also used about a teaspoon of juice from grated ginger root. It was delicious.',1
I thought this receipe was very good!  I added a 1/2 c. of chopped walnuts to the batter and omited the raisins.  I also sprinkled some brown sugar on top before baking.  I thought it was great!,1
Very easy to make and very moist. Not a lot of flavor. I may try it using the ideas of adding craisins and nuts or  nutmeg and ginger.,1
This is one of my favorites now.Turned out great. Wouldn''t change a thing maybe add nuts!',1
Delicious apple bread - great for breakfast.,1
It was a pretty interesting recipe :)  A good way to use up my left over applesauce that no one was eating.,1
something different. I would recommend spreading a cinnamon glaze on top,0
Very tasty.  I like it,1
We love applesauce breads and this one is easy and very moist.   Some reviewers said it did not have enough flavor (which I tend to agree with).,1
this turned out great! I used less oil brown sugar and I added chocolate chips and nuts. thanks for sharing!,1
Delicious and easy.  I didn't have enough applesauce so I added a drained can (small) of fruit cocktail (minus the cherries - yuk!). I substituted chopped walnuts for the raisins.,1
I use low fat plain yogurt instead of sour cream and slash 1/2 cup of sugar since the applesauce already been added sugar. Bread is so good.,1
This Applesauce Bread is wonderful.  The recipe is very versatile.  ,1
This is a great recipe!  I used chopped pecans and hazelnuts.  I think pistacios would be even better and will use them next time.,1
This is excellent.  I made one mistake though in using too many nuts.  The idea is that there will be enough of each layer in contact with the one below so that it seals together.,1
Very easy and everyone loved it! I asked a greek family member about making baklava before had and she said just to be sure to use lots of butter.,1
Very good baklava.  I have made it twice now.  The second time I added 1/8 of a tsp of nutmeg.  I melted the butter and used a silicone brush to brush it on.,1
Very good--easy to make in my opionion because it doesn''t really call for any cooking just assembly--no more work than assembling a lasagna.,1
I did not care for this recipe. It is FAR from being authentic Greek baklava.The baklava was dry it took way less than 50 minutes to bake.,0
I made this last year at Christmas and everyone was impressed (I usually just do cookies).  It was so easy and delish my cousin said it was as good as his Greek friends Baklava.,1
This was the best baklava I''ve ever had - let alone the best I''ve ever made!! This recipe is a sure bet for anyone - from amatuer to expert baker!!!,1
This was probably the best baklava I have ever tasted.  I brought it to a tailgate party and everyone was impressed (they didn''t know how easy it was.),1
This really is fabulous!  Much better than at the deli.  I didn''t use much more than half the nut mixture though.  The recipe was a bit unclear as to how to finish the top.,1
Time consuming but worth the effort in the end.,1
"Delicious,  well worth the time and effort!!",1
"Oh Yay!  I have never made any kind of bread from scratch before, and I was really nervous about this one.  I was simply ASTOUNDED by how easy it really was.  Particularly rolling out the dough.",1
